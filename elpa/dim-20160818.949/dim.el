;;; Commentary:

;; The purpose of this package is to "customize" the mode-line names of
;; major and minor modes.  An example of using:
;;
;; (when (require 'dim nil t)
;;   (dim-major-names
;;    '((emacs-lisp-mode    "EL")
;;      (lisp-mode          "CL")
;;      (Info-mode          "I")
;;      (help-mode          "H")))
;;   (dim-minor-names
;;    '((auto-fill-function " â†µ")
;;      (isearch-mode       " ðŸ”Ž")
;;      (whitespace-mode    " _"  whitespace)
;;      (paredit-mode       " ()" paredit)
;;      (eldoc-mode         ""    eldoc))))

;; Along with `dim-major-names' and `dim-minor-names', you can use
;; `dim-major-name' and `dim-minor-name' to change the names by one.

;; Many thanks to the author of
;; <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/delight.el> package, as the code of
;; this file is heavily based on it.

;; For more verbose description, see README at

;;; Code:

(defgroup dim nil
  "Change mode-line names of major and minor modes."
  :group 'convenience)

(defcustom dim-everywhere nil
  "If non-nil, just set `mode-name' to the 'dimmed' name.
If nil, try to be more clever to change the name only for the
mode-line.  Particularly, display the original `mode-name' in the
mode description (\\[describe-mode])."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'dim)

(defvar dim-major-names nil
  "List of specifications for changing `mode-name'.
Each element of the list should be a list of arguments taken by
`dim-major-name' function.")

(defvar dim-inhibit-major-name nil
  "If non-nil, original mode names are used instead of names from
`dim-major-names' variable.")

(defun dim-get-major-name (mode)
  "Return MODE name from `dim-major-names' variable."
  (cadr (assq mode dim-major-names)))

(defun dim-set-major-name (&rest _)
  "Replace `mode-name' of the current major mode.
Use the appropriate name from `dim-major-names' variable.

This function ignores the arguments to make it suitable for using
in advices.  For example, if you changed `mode-name' of
`dired-mode', you'll be surprised that it returns to \"Dired\"
after exiting from `wdired-mode'.  This happens because \"Dired\"
string is hard-coded in `wdired-change-to-dired-mode'.  This can
be workaround-ed by using the following advice:

  (advice-add 'wdired-change-to-dired-mode :after #'dim-set-major-name)"
  (let ((new-name (dim-get-major-name major-mode)))
    (when new-name
      (setq mode-name
            (if dim-everywhere
                new-name

This function is intended to be used as an 'around' advice for
FUN.  Such advice is needed for `format-mode-line' function, as
it allows to use the original `mode-name' value when it is
displayed in `describe-mode' help buffer."
