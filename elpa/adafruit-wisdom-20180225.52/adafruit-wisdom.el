;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I've always enjoyed the engineering quotes found at the footer of
;; each page on adafruit.com ... now you can too!  This code is
;; derived from Dave Pearson's dad-joke.el, except adafruit.com
;; publishes their quotes as rss so we have to deal with that.

;;; Code:

(require 'dom)
(require 'url)
(require 'xml)

(defconst adafruit-wisdom-quote-url "https://www.adafruit.com/feed/quotes.xml"
  "URL for the RSS quote feed served on adafruit.com.")

(defconst adafruit-wisdom-cache-file "adafruit-wisdom.cache"
  "Location for the local copy of the quotes file.")

(defconst adafruit-wisdom-cache-ttl (* 3600.0 24.0) ; 24 hours
  "Time-to-live for the local cache file.")

(defun adafruit-wisdom-cached-get ()
  "Retrieves RSS from adafruit.com, or from cache if TTL hasn't expired.
Returns the parsed XML."
  (let* ((cache (locate-user-emacs-file adafruit-wisdom-cache-file))
         (mtime (nth 5 (file-attributes cache)))
         (age   (and mtime (- (float-time (current-time))
                              (float-time mtime)))))
    (if (and age (< age adafruit-wisdom-cache-ttl))
        (with-temp-buffer
          (insert-file-contents cache)
          (xml-parse-region (point-min) (point-max)))
      (with-temp-file cache
        (url-insert-file-contents adafruit-wisdom-quote-url)
        (xml-parse-region (point-min) (point-max))))))

         (pick  (nth (random (length items)) items))
