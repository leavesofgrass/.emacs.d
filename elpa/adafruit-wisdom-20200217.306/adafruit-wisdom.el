;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I've always enjoyed the engineering quotes found at the footer of
;; each page on adafruit.com ... now you can too!  This code is
;; derived from Dave Pearson's dad-joke.el, except adafruit.com
;; publishes their quotes as rss so we have to deal with that.

;;; Code:

(require 'request)
(require 'xml)

  "Location for the local copy of the quotes file.
When `no-littering' is available put the cache file in the
specified var directory.  Otherwise the default location for the
cache file is `user-emacs-directory'.")
