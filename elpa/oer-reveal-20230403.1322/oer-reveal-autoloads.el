arguments are properly expanded to work with all Org versions,
also after an incompatible change with Org 9.2.

Change Emacs environment.
Load babel languages in `oer-reveal-publish-babel-languages',

Also fix internal slide references by assignment to
`org-re-reveal--href-fragment-prefix', see its doc string.  Note that
this change needs `setq' before `org-re-reveal-ref' is loaded, as
that library again uses `setq'.  Also, using `oer-reveal--add-advice-link'
during publication needs the proper value.")
