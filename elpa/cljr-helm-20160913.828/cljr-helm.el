;;; Commentary:

;; A Helm wrapper for the cljr features.

;; Remembering key bindings for cljr is hard, especially the less
;; frequently used ones - this should help with that.

;; This package is available in melpa as `cljr-helm`. So doing `M-x
;; install-package RET cljr-helm` should get you what you need.

;; Then add `(require 'cljr-helm)` to your init file, bind `cljr-helm` to
;; a key (I'd suggest `C-c C-r`) in Clojure mode, and you're ready to go.

;;; Code:

(require 'helm)
(require 'clj-refactor)

(defun cljr-helm-candidates ()
  (mapcar (lambda (c)
            (concat (car c) ": " (cl-second (cdr c))))
          cljr--all-helpers))

(defvar helm-source-cljr
  '((name . "cljr functions hlel")
    (candidates . cljr-helm-candidates)
    (persistent-action . ignore)
    (action . (("Run" . (lambda (candidate)
                          (string-match "^\\(.+?\\): " candidate)
                          (call-interactively
                           (cadr (assoc (match-string 1 candidate) cljr--all-helpers)))))))))

;;;###autoload
(defun cljr-helm ()
  (interactive)
  (helm-other-buffer 'helm-source-cljr "*cljr*"))

(provide 'cljr-helm)
